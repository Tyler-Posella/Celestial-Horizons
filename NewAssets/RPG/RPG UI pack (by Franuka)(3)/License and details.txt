-------------------------
Thank you for getting this asset pack!
Make sure to check my other assets to complement this one (https://franuka.itch.io/)

Free updates might be added in the future, so stay tuned!

TERMS OF USE:
------------
* You may use this pack on both commercial AND non-commercial projects, just remember to add a link to my itch page and/or Twitter/X, it helps a lot :) (Links below)
* You can edit this pack, but you can not redistribute it as is or resell it elsewhere. Feel free to send me a message regarding specific cases. Thanks!

Included are UI assets in three sizes: 100% (16x16px grid), 200% (32x32px grid) and 300% (48x48px grid), in .png format, transparent background. There's also two .ttf pixel fonts, for texts and titles.

FONTS:
------
* In terms of font size, 'FantasyRPGtext' should be used at multiples of 8, and 'FantasyRPGtitle' at multiples of 11. This is important to retain the pixel look, since these are not vectorial fonts.

All assets were created from scratch by me.
